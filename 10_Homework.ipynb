       "  'comment': 'Why do people enjoy cock and ball torture? The act of intentionally or accidentally bringing pain upon the male genitals is typically a thought that people wince at with great force. However, there is a reason why this is an enjoyable experience. One rooted in the most important of sciences. Physics. Take, for example, a bottle of Tobasco Sauce. If one where to move the bottle up and down in a motion reminiscent to the one used during male self-stimulation it typically results in a moderate amount of sauce exiting the bottle. If struck hard on the bottom, however, a large amount will spurt out. Should this be done with the name genitals, turning them upside down and then striking the bottom of the scrotum with moderate to immense force, this will result in a large amount of seed to be ejected from the penis due to the energy being transferred from the palm of the hand to genitals. Therefore, because of physics and the transfer of energy from palm to the genitals, cock and ball torture is a scientifically pleasurable experience. *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They then started dating after about 3 weeks of knowing eachother and they did not once meet in person. Then after 3 days of them being Alexa broke up with Jason. It wasn’t a big deal and neither of them even considered it a relationship. But during the time they talked Jason introduced her to me and our main friend group and we’d all occasionally FaceTime together. \\nSo after a while me (15m) and Alexa sort of talked a little more and I was interested in her. So I asked Jason if I could act on it and ask her out. He said yes though he seemed to not expect her to have feelings for me too. Me and Alexa started dating. Jason in the beginning made fun of our relationship but eventually got over it and just accepted it. Me and her went on many dates did stuff sexually and had been very intimate. Eventually after almost 2 months of ya dating she decided to break up with me. I was very upset about it for a bit but eventually got over it. A WEEK after Jason hit her up again on insta to attempt to get back with her . I asked why he would do that and he said he wasn’t having much luck with girls recently and so he was re-attempting with her. I got really mad. But he says I’m TA because he allowed it when I did the same thing  \\nI eventually just said this was not at all the same thing BECUASE they dated for three days and never saw eachother in person. While me and her had a longer and more intimate relationship and the breakup actually hurt  AITA? *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.\\n2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.\\n3.

Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit. **First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it. **New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything.  New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly. **If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.* If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq). **If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below. * /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      \\n* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback\\n* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback\\n* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback\\n* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  \\n* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations\\n* /r/remix - share your remixes\\n* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production* The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician. As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)*** Bit of backstory here: my second husband and I got sober together on literally the same day. As of 2019, I have 20 years of continuous sobriety, even though Mike died of heart failure 17 years ago. During this time, I married my current husband Brian 13 years ago. I am actively involved in a 12 Step program, attend meetings regularly, and speak on my anneversary. As Brian is a \"normie,\" i.e., not alcoholic or anything, he doesn\\'t go to any of my weekly meetings. He has not gone to one of my speaker meetings in many years.  However, this year I FINALLY found out why. Apparently, it makes him feel uncomfortable when I talk about Mike\\'s death, especially because I often get choked up at that point in the story. He never told me that before - he just made excuses to not go or bowed out because \"he\\'s heard it all before.\" (To be honest, the story doesn\\'t change all that much over the years.) After he finally got honest about this point, he made a snide remark about the one picture that I have up in the house of Mike. It is in our room, not prominently displayed, but it is there. I have thought about moving it to the spare bedroom, but I am not comfortable with just shuffling it off to an unused part of the house. I thought I was being respectful by not having it in the living room like it was before we started dating. So, AITA? *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.\\n2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.\\n3. If you are trading shiny Pokémon, please make sure that your post and other users’ offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules).

Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.\\n2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.\\n3. If you are trading shiny Pokémon, please make sure that your post and other users’ offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules).

Both conditions must be met in their entirety and no exceptions will be made at all.

Participate in the subreddit if you want to post in the subreddit. New users need to have a feel for this website before we allow them to post on this subreddit.   Comment karma is *not* the same thing as link karma. You get comment karma for making good comments that people upvote. You lose comment karma if you make dogshit comments that people downvote. If you have less than 100 comment karma, it is easy to get- simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all. On your user page you will see a breakdown of post versus comment karma; you may need to hover over the karma number (or the i icon) to see the details.

Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.\\n2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.\\n3. If you are trading shiny Pokémon, please make sure that your post and other users’ offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules).

Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.\\n2. Verify who you are trading with.

Background is that he is 50, never married, has very little social life, doesn’t seem to be able to connect with with women... he just seems lonely, and his isolation is getting worse as he gets older. He likes to exercise and is social when given an opportunity, but I feel like he is greatly lacking in community. He loves our dog and enjoys going for runs or walks in the park near his house.  He doesn’t travel much. He has a fenced yard and kids in the neighborhood or hood who walk dogs in the afternoon for money. It’s a perfect setup for a taking on a dog as a pet. But he has resisted the idea for years. It makes me so sad to think of him coming home to an empty house night after night and I think a dog could be transformative for him - not only would it be companionship, it might help him connect with others. But I’m left feeling guilty that I annoyed him. If he seemed happy, I would leave him alone, but he really doesn’t seem content with his life. *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.\\n2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.\\n3. If you are trading shiny Pokémon, please make sure that your post and other users’ offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules).

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit. **First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it. **New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything.  New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly. **If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.* If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq). **If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below. * /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      \\n* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback\\n* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback\\n* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback\\n* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  \\n* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations\\n* /r/remix - share your remixes\\n* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production* The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician. As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.\\n2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.\\n3. If you are trading shiny Pokémon, please make sure that your post and other users’ offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules).

I took the bus to get to a certain place and on the ride till there I noticed a guy that took a few glances at me from time to time but I didn't think much of it. Once I got off I totally forgot about it. After a few hours I had to get on a bus again, and so it happened that the same guy was in the bus. We stood pretty close with a few people between us. He was glancing at me once again and the intervals got shorter and shorter and he started staring at me at one point. I got extremely shy and smiled a few times because I didn't know what to do. This thing has never happened to me before! So as he started staring at me I got a little daring and started staring back. At this point I was curious how this thing would end. Suddenly, he approached me and told me that he noticed how we had been looking at eachother and introduced himself. I introduced myself as well, he asked for my instagram, I gave it to him and he hopped off. He caught me off guard, I didn't have time to think things through. I was never prepared for such a thing. He followed me on instagram, liked a few of my photos and messaged me. He messaged me an awful sentence that made me repulsed by him, and now that I think about the whole thing again, I come to the conclusion that I was amused by the whole situation rather than me being attracted to him. Would I be the asshole if I don't reply to him, and If I should reply what do I say? *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.\\n2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.\\n3. If you are trading shiny Pokémon, please make sure that your post and other users’ offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules).

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)*** So, my husband and I are making thanksgiving dinner tonight as stated. We invited my FIL, my BIL, and my SIL. We are currently staying with my parents because I just got my CDL and I’m waiting for my trainer to go on the road.  My father in law messaged me this morning and told me he was bringing his girlfriend. His girlfriend has stolen from my husband and I, and from the same daughter that is attending as well. She’s also stolen from my FIL, and has disrespected each and everyone of us multiple times. I let my FIL know she wasn’t welcome here because of what happened previously and he told me, “Well, I forgave you for what you did but it’s cool.” I also want to mention now his girlfriend is a drug addict and has a stealing problem so I didn’t want my parents to be around her or have something go missing from their house.  Here is what he is talking about: When I met my husband, he was living with his mother and his sister in a 3 bedroom house. His sister slept in her moms room and had two cats locked inside hers. She fed them once a week and that is it. The room was filled of shit and piss for three years. Couldn’t walk in there without coughing up a lung. Mother and my husband knew of this but didn’t do anything. I rescued the cats and took them to the shelter, his sister didn’t realize they were gone until 6 days later. So they blew up on me, yelled at me, the whole ordeal. He’s basically saying he forgave me for shoving his daughters depression in their face and the animal abuse she was doing so they could no longer ignore it.  Anyway, my husband sided with me mostly. He didn’t want his fathers gf here neither. But then he sided with his father when he told my husband that he had forgiven me and that he never judged me.  I am so hurt at the comparison. I no longer want to make Thanksgiving. Anyway, my husband has been crying because I refuse to talk to him so naturally, my entire family has taken his side and told me I need to talk to him. Every single time we argue, it’s my fault and I need to talk to him because oh my god he’s crying. I’m tired of my family defending him. I don’t know what to do. I want to cancel thanksgiving, I just don’t feel comfortable anymore, and my husband refused. He said I didn’t have to attend and he will cook everything. This is in my parents kitchen by the way.  I don’t know what to do? Please help. AITA? TL;DR my husband and I argued after his father said he was bringing his gf who has stolen from us and disrespected us. *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.\\n2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.\\n3. If you are trading shiny Pokémon, please make sure that your post and other users’ offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules).
